## data.table Package

This is a tutorial on the `data.table` package, which we will learn in Week 2.

### Installation of data.table

You can use `pacman::p_load(data.table)` command on both Windows and MacOS to install and load the `data.table` package. You can use all the funtionality of `data.table` package without issues.

However, if you manually load the package using

```
library(data.table)
```

You may find that, there is a warning message, saying that "This installation of data.table has not detected OpenMP support. It should still work but in single-threaded mode." 

It means that using the default installation method, `data.table` package can only utilize a single core of your computer, even if your CPU may have 4 cores or more. We know that one of the biggest advantages of `data.table` over `dplyr` or `pandas` is its efficiency and great performance. So we do not want to lose this advantage on MacOS.

The `data.table` official [github page](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation) offers a more comprehensive guide on how to install `data.table`, but it contains lots of information and you may get lost easily. Below, I will show you an easier step-by-step guide on how to install `data.table` to enable its OpenMP capability on Mac. If you failed the installation with my guide, please refer back to the official guide to troubleshoot.

(p.s. I do not own the latest M1 Mac, and the tutorial below applies to Intel-based Macbooks.)

#### Step 1: Install a clang compiler that supports OpenMP

Simply put, in recent MacOS releases, the default clang (c-language) compiler disables support for OpenMP. That's why with the default installation, we do not have OpenMP. The solution is to use a C complier that supports OpenMP.

In this guide, we will be using the gfortran complier. 

- Go to this page <https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases>, and download the `.dmg` file that suits your MacOS. For instance, I am using BigSur and a Intel-based Macbook, so I will download and install gfortran-intel-11.1-BigSur.dmg.


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datatable/datatable_gfortran.png")
```

- After downloading the dmg file, install it accordingly.



- Ensure that you have command line tools installed. **Do NOT** skip this step. It is essential. To do so, open Mac's `Terminal`, which is a Mac built-in app as below:

```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width='25%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datatable/datatable_terminal.png")
```

- Type (or copy paste) the following into your terminal and hit enter to run:

```
xcode-select --install
```

like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datatable/datatable_terminal2.png")
```

If you get an error message: xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates, then you already have command line tools and can proceed to the next step. Else please follow the onscreen instructions and install it first.

#### Step 2: Take the gfortran path

-   After installing gfortran, open `Finder`.

-   Press `shift` + `command` + `G`; Paste "/usr/local/gfortran" into `Finder` as in the screenshot, and hit `Enter`

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datatable/datatable_finder.png")
```

-   You should see this now:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datatable/datatable_finder2.png")
```

If you see the "gfortran" folder, with subfolders named "bin", "include", etc., it means you have successfully found out the path of your gfortran installation. Otherwise, you may need to figure out the correct path.

#### Step 3: Create and edit "Makevars"

-   Open `Terminal`.

-   Run the following code in `Terminal` to change the current directory to "~/.r"

```
cd ~/.r
```

-   Run the following code in `Terminal` to create a new file named Makevar in folder "~/.r"
```
touch Makevars
```

-   Now go to `Finder`, press `Shift` + `Command` + `G`; Paste "\~/.r/Makevars" and go to the folder; Open the "Makevars" file with TextEdit app, as in the screenshot.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/datatable/datatable_makevars.png")
```

-   Copy paste the following text into "Makevars" file.

```
    LOC = /usr/local/gfortran
    CC=$(LOC)/bin/gcc -fopenmp
    CXX=$(LOC)/bin/g++ -fopenmp
    CXX11 = $(LOC)/bin/g++ -fopenmp # for fst package
    CXX14=$(LOC)/bin/g++ -fopenmp
    CXX17=$(LOC)/bin/g++ -fopenmp
    CXX1X=$(LOC)/bin/g++ -fopenmp

    CFLAGS=-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic -std=gnu99 -mtune=native -pipe
    CXXFLAGS=-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11 -mtune=native -pipe -Wno-unused 
    LDFLAGS=-L$(LOC)/lib -Wl,-rpath,$(LOC)/lib 
    CPPFLAGS=-I$(LOC)/include -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include 
```

-   Save the file and exit

#### Step 4: Install data.table again from source.

Now open `Rstudio` and install data.table package using this command:

```
install.packages('data.table', type = 'source')
```

If you see the following rolling compilation process, then congratulations, after a while, you should be able to use `data.table` package with OpenMP support!

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datatable/datatable_install.png")
```
