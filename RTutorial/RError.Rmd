## Common R Errors and Troubleshooting

### Where you can run R codes

As discussed in the R Basics tutorial, you can run R codes in 3 places.

#### R Console

If the code is simple and just one line, then you can type the command in R console (NOT terminal, they are different; Console is the first tab)

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = "images/class5_RConsole.png")
```

#### R Script

- R Script has the extension of `.R`, and any text in this file will be treated as R codes, just like a python .py file.

- R Script (with `.R` extension) is not a R Markdown file (with `.Rmd` extension)

- R Script is used when there is no need to generate any report and you just need to write some codes and run some analyses. In this case, R Scripts are the best choice.

To create a new R Script, click the `insert new file` button, and select `R Script` option:

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = "images/class5_addRScript.png")
```

And then, you can copy the codes in lecture slides and paste them into R Script file. 
Select the codes you want to run and run them by hitting the `Run` button (not the `Knit` button; `Knit` is only for generating reports from .Rmd file). 

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = "images/class5_RScript.png")
```

#### R Markdown

In a `.Rmd` file, R codes can only be run in R code chunks; otherwise, they will be treated as normal text. We have discussed how to use R Markdown file in Week 2.

### Packages not installed

If you see this banner in your RStudio in the screenshot, it means RStudio detects some packages mentioned in the R Markdown file or R script but are not yet installed on your computer. So it prompts you for installation.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = "images/class5_RErrorPackageNotInstalled.png")
```

For instance, in this case, the error message means, `knitr` and `pacman` are found in the .Rmd file, but they are not installed, so RStudio is smart enough to prompt you to install. 

**Solution:** Just click install button in the banner. RStudio will install the missing components.

### R packages not up-to-date

Since the R packages are being updated every day (just like our mobile apps, there could be bugs so that the developers have to update R packages to fix those bugs), sometimes, though we may have installed some packages, they are too old to run the functions. And you may see this prompted message:

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = "images/class5_RErrorPackageNeedsUpdated.png")
```

It means, the aforementioned packages, `base64enc`, `digest`, etc. are outdated and must be updated to function. 

**Solution:** Click `Yes` and RStudio will update all the packages for you.


### Latex not found when kniting the .Rmd file.

In Class 4, I gave you the "Preliminary Customer Analysis.Rmd". You should be fine to run the codes in the code chunks. However, if this is your first time to knit the PDF document, you may see an error message as below:

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = "images/class5_RErrorLatexNotFound.png")
```

In the future, whenever you see such error messages, the first step is to take a breath, then get a coffee from Level 50, and finally start reading the error message. The error message usually tells you everything on how to troubleshoot (that's what an error message is for!).

In this screenshot, if you read along, you will find the cause of problem: 

>[...] LaTex failed to compile, 

because

> [...] No LaTeX installation detected (LaTeX is required to create PDF output).

and the **solution** is also consideratebly given in this error message:

> [...] You should install a LaTeX distribution for your platform: https://www.latex-project.org/get/

>  If you are not sure, you may install TinyTeX in R: tinytex::install_tinytex()

So this error message tells us the **solution**: run the following command in Console

`tinytex::install_tinytex()`

in order to install LaTex on your laptop.

If you run the command in R Console, you will see that Latex is being installed 

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = "images/Class5_RErrorInstallTinyTex.png")
```

After this progress bar finishes, you will be able to knit the PDF document!

### Connection Not Found

In Class 4, I mentioned this problem. Connection Not Found is usually caused by RStudio being unable to locate your files on your hard disk. 

In the .Rmd file I give to you, the purchase data and demographics data are using the file paths on my laptop. So you should change them to yours.

If you don't know how to find the path names for a file on your computer, please refer to this [link](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00015251) for Windows and this [link](https://macpaw.com/how-to/get-file-path-mac) for Mac.
